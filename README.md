Space Adventure Arcade Game

This project is a result of my desire to write a game of my own. The Alpha version of this game is over. 
However, I realized that it is more widely accepted and supported if a game is writen using OpenGL. 

May be the beta version will be using OpenGL then. 

If you would like to play this game. You can either download the source code and run the main class on any machine which has JDK.
If you want an executable then you can download the exe from http://techieme.in/games-fun/
